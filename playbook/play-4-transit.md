# Play 4: Transit

**Ensure AV technology strengthens mass transit**

## Summary:

AVs have the potential to completely transform how the public transit system operates. By redefining the size, frequency, and routes of busses, better integrating with Transportation Network Companies \(TNC\), and receiving priority road space thanks to the space efficiency benefits of AVs, transit has an important role to play in the new transportation paradigm. Investing in public transit will be critical to reducing VMT once AV technology is widely adopted as the ultimate impact of AVs on VMT is not certain. Planning for changes to the built environment, realignments of the public right-of-way and, the integration of AV technologies into transit will give us a head start on achieving the community's goals. Most of today's thriving cities feature strong transit systems and there are no indications that the thriving cities of the future will be any different.

## Action Steps:

1. Develop a Request For Information \(RFI\) to learn how TARC could work with Transportation Network Companies \(TNC\) and AV technology manufacturers to provide first & last mile connections during TARC's Comprehensive Operations Analysis and Long Range Planning Process
2. Evaluate how AV technology could affect TARC operations, including adoption of autonomous transit vehicles, over the next 20 years as part of the upcoming TARC Long-Range Plan and Comprehensive Operations Analysis
