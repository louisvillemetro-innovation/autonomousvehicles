# Play 2: Partnerships

**Forge public and private partnerships to prepare for new regulatory and technological challenges, anticipate emerging technologies, and establish best practices.**

## Summary:

Because cities are not empowered to chart their own destinies regarding AVs, Louisville must build strong local and national relationships. Our partners must include local businesses, not for profit organizations, governmental organizations, local and state transportation authorities, and those bringing emerging technologies to the city. By being proactive, Louisville will get a say in how this technology will be integrated into the community. By building partnerships and trust, we will make sure that Louisville benefits as much as possible from AV technology.

## Action Steps:

1. Designate specific areas in Louisville for potential AV testing sites and AV fleet storage.
2. Work with State and local partners to develop a legal framework for Autonomous Vehicle testing in Kentucky including updating the legal definition of the term "driver" in light of new technology.
3. Develop relationships with leaders in the AV industry
4. Create a process to update this playbook as AV technologies and community priorities change and new partnerships are created.
