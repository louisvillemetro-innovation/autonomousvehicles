# Current Projects

* Create a framework as part of a complete streets process to evaluate the potential of AVs to impact infrastructure projects, land use decisions, Vehicle Miles Traveled \(VMT\), and government operations with respect to different levels of adoption and varying ownership models
* Assess Electric Vehicle \(EV\) charging infrastructure needs and create a plan to grow the EV charging network to support AV adoption and general trends in EV car ownership
* All new parking facilities will be constructed so that they may be repurposed, unless architecturally unfeasible.
* Create a data-platform that will be able to host, manage, and share data necessary for AV/CV operations and the related technologies
