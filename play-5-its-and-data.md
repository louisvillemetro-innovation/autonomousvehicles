# Play 5: ITS & Data

**Develop and maintain transportation technology and data infrastructure to encourage innovation and promote accountability**

## Summary:

Providing transportation infrastructure is one of the most important jobs of a local government. Today, Louisville Metro's transportation network has an estimated value of over $5 billion. Maintaining a safe, efficient network is critical to the city's future. Continuing to do so will require new investments in new systems, technologies, and data management structures as well as continued reinvestment in our current assets. AVs will require the technology and data components of our system to be more substantially built out and maintained due to the data heavy nature of the autonomous future. With the ability of AVs and Connected Vehicles \(CVs\) to communicate with the infrastructure, cars, and travelers around them, Louisville needs to make investments in technology and data infrastructure to help facilitate that communication and data exchange, which will be a new core competency required of any publicly-maintained transportation system.

## Action Steps:

1. Make investments in Intelligent Transportation System \(ITS\) that better position Louisville to support and integrate AV/CV technology
2. Create a data-platform that will be able to host, manage, and share data necessary for AV/CV operations and the related technologies
3. Create data-sharing partnerships with AV and TNCs operating in Louisville Metro for increased collaboration and transparency
4. When legally allowable, post all relevant data and information about AV/CV initiatives on our Open Data portal to promote transparency, and data-sharing
